            time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most
            in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going
            through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing
            the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac
            and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other
            languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company
            on business software, C# is a great choice.</p>

              been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many

                <p class="p4">Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web

                  information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good
                  chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails
                  framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common
                  tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular
                  with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their
                  product quickly. Though each language has its niche, there is
                  plenty of crossover. For example, Rails' popularity inspired
                  copycats in just about every language, and so you'll see interactive
                  web applications written in C#, Java, and PHP, with Rails-like
                  frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and Laravel. Even at one
                  company, you might find them using PHP for their marketing site,
                  Ruby for their web application, and Java for their back-end

                <p class="p5">React is a javaScrip library for building user interfaces.
                  React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views
                  for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update
                  and render just the right components when your data changes.
                  Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
                  Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose
                  them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in
                  JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data
                  through your app and keep state out of the DOM. We donâ€™t make
                  assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop
                  new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also
                  render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.</p>
